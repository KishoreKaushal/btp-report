In this chapter, we will review some challenges to 

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we proposed a distributed algorithm
for construction of xyz.
The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.
Next chapter presents
another distributed algorithm which has linear time 
complexity based on xyz.
